# Maria Gorin

My name is Maria and this is my first HTML/CSS project - My Portfolio.

This is a link to my website.. 

This is a link to my my GitHub repository..

### Purpose an Target Audience

I created this Website as an assignment for my ongoing study to become a web developer. All the code related to this website was written by me based on my design.

The main purpose of this project was to create a personal portfolio site to demonstrate my HTML/CSS skills and abilities and to tell a little bit about myself and my future goals.

In the future this portfolio can be used as a virtual resume for potential employers and business partners.

### Functionaliti/Features

My portfolio contains 5 pages:
- Home
- About me
- Portfolio
- Blog
- Contact for

Here is sitemap

All of those pages are equipped with a navigation bar on top of the content.

All of the pages also contain links to my professional social media accounts GitHub and LInkedIn

"About me" page has a quick introduction and a timeline. There is also a link to my resume (which is a mock-up resume at this point)

"Blog" page has 5 blog items with images. I used flex-box for this page and made it responsive to mobile-view by changing flex-direction. Each item is set a maximum height and has a scroll bar to fit larger content without changing the look of the page. 

"Portfolio" page is made to show my current and future projects. I used grid to organize content of the page and made it responsive by changing the widths of the columns in a mobile view.

"Contact me" form is mainly a contact form linked to my e-mail through Formspree.

### Design

In a choice of colors I was inspired by a picture of Cherry blossom (Photo by Arno Smit on Unsplash) which reminded me of my childhood in the east of Russia at the Japanese sea.

I used Figma to pick the colors and fonts for my project.
These are a couple of screenshots I took in a progress

These are a couple of wireframes I drew for the project.

This one is for the Home page:

### The Tech

#### The code

This Project is written on HTML and CSS. It contains five .html files and one .css stylesheet.

The styles are written in one file divided by sections with comments for easy navigation through it. Media query is written at the end of the file. 

I used w3 validator to validate HTML code and made corrections of errors followed by the results it gave me.
I repeated the validation process following the correction of errors and it came up with no further errors or warnings.

#### Deployment

Netlify is used to make this project live.

#### Subresource Integrity
